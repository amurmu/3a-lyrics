	<p>Verse 1 Sway<br />
	We put in practice and discipline<br />
	No giving up, no giving in<br />
	We're match fit, we're here to win<br />
	For those who don't know better fill them in, fill them in<br />
	Information, information<br />
	We're the realest out here, no imitation<br />
	Been all around the world, no immigration<br />
	And we getting in without an invitation<br />
	Bridge Sway<br />
	Sound travels and the ground shakes<br />
	And our society has got us on a wild chase<br />
	Tell 'em we'll be back in sixty seconds with the loud bass<br />
	We're moving at our pace, yeah<br />
	Verse 2 Sway<br />
	Yeah, keep saying stuff<br />
	The boy linked up with Sway and stuff<br />
	C8 to the UK and stuff<br />
	Got 'em all on the floor like a praying monk<br />
	What's the tempo, what's the tempo?<br />
	Cut from the same cloth, what we do with info?<br />
	And we ain't gonna wait for no invitation<br />
	Before we get involved<br />
	See, I'm never gonna suffer, put 'em on a sound wave<br />
	All over the earth we can make the ground shake<br />
	Ever since birth it was word to the (?)<br />
	Just wanted to rap and make the crowd say<br />
	We got information, information<br />
	We're the realest out here, no imitation<br />
	Been all around the world, no immigration<br />
	And we getting in without an invitation<br />
	Chorus Sway<br />
	Bounce with me, bounce! Bounce!<br />
	Hook Sway<br />
	I'm a dragon</p>
